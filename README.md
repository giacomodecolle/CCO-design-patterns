# CCO-design-patterns

A repository for the coordination of National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) efforts in creating Design Patterns (DPs) for the [Common Core Ontologies (CCO)](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology), a suite of twelve ontologies extending the Top-Level Ontology (TLO) [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology) to establish a representation standard at a lower level of generality than BFO.

The aim of creating these DPs is to lower the barrier of entry into using CCO, as well as creating a shared consensus on the usage of CCO resources.

## Materials 
This directory contains the following materials.
- A main folder storing guidelines for designing DPs.
- A main folder storing templates for construction DPs and related directories.
- [A main folder storing DPs.](https://github.com/giacomodecolle/CCO-design-patterns/tree/main/design-patterns)

## General Conventions 

The preferred format for DPs is Mermaid, although an image in PNG/SVG or similar should also be provided. The current style choice is the following:

- Yellow box for classes (color #ffe680)
- Purple diamond for instances (color #dbc9ef)
- White boxes for data (color #ffffff)
- Shortened IRI/identifier for the classes
- Labelled nodes for object properties
- Shortened IRI/identifier for object properties
- Explicit names as examples for instances, e.g. "Giacomo" instead of "Person 1"
