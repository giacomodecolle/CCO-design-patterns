# Templates for DPs Folder Design 

This directory contains templates and guidelines to organize DPs folders, specifically a template for the README file, a template for DP in Mermaid and PNG/SVG format, and a template for SPARQL queries.

## Guidelines

Please structure your DP directory as follows and store it as a subfolder of the main ["Design Patterns" directory](https://github.com/giacomodecolle/CCO-design-patterns/tree/main/design-patterns).
- A main folder named according to the corresponding DP and containing the README file and two subfolders, each one containing the following materials.
- A subfolder to store DPs in Mermaid and PNG/SVG format, and a related README file for description.
- A subfolder to store SPARQL queries and a related README file for description.
