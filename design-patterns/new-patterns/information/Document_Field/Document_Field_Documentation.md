# Pattern Name
Document Field

## Compentency Questions
1) What document is this document field a part of?

2) How many document fields are in the document?

3) What is the content on these document fields?

## Intent
Showing the document field is a part of a document. 

Comes in hand when representing documents with multiple fields, so that we can link more than one ICE to the same IBE.

## Structure
The document has as parts two document fields. One of them carries one ICE, specifically a designative Name.

Despite using names as an example, this pattern can be used with any other ICE.
