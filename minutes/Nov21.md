On the agenda today:

1) review of PR from Cristian
2) review of citations from the literature on the definition of design pattern, compiled by Giacomo
3) review of paper outline from Elena

Elena shares update on the paper outline.

Fabricio argues that there are different ways of building DPs and for different purposes. For example, creating an ontology vs creating a pattern from scratch
vs creating documentation.
We should identify which of these we are talking about before we write the paper.

We discuss definitions taken from papers on what a design pattern is.

Fede argues that we have to distinguish between language-specific and language-independent patterns. If we choose RDF then we have to be clear about it.

It seems that our design patterns are the ones which the literature calls content or domain design patterns. See http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/index.php/OPTypes

Giorgio: patterns as modeling solutions, language agnostic. We then have concretizations of these solutions, which are the files we work with.

Fabricio: we can take a look at older versions of the website to look at their example.

Giacomo: we can take a look at software architecture books 
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture

TODOs: 
1) Fabricio to look into archive and to write down the three versions of building patterns
2) Giacomo to research LLMs
3) Ray and the PHASES team to work on a narratives DP
4) Giacomo to share slides, then the team polishes it and put them together (Elena to help)
5) Someone to review of PR from Cristian
