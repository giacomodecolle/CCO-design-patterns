Regina reports on the work done with Ray and Nour on collecting competency questions to develop narratives design patterns. 

The group debated differences between different types of narratives and its meaning (GDC vs process). Regina has been working on solitude and modeled it.

Regina shows a model taken from a FOIS paper describing physical solitude and we discuss how we could also model social solitude. We also discuss the difficulties in representing lacks and negatives.

Regina and Elena raise worries about having to go too much in depth in the discussion of the patterns and losing the reader, especially if these patterns are using content that is too much in depth in the PHASES/CCO jargon.

We discuss the potential issue of having too much content and of this content feeling scattered and disunited. Giacomo argues that the paper should focus on the methodology, the quality evaluation of the patterns, etc. and that we should only point at a few examples. The bulk of the content should avoid focusing on what CCO is, or what PHASES is, etc. This should prevent such issues from arising.

We discuss using agentic AI tools (Codex and Cursor) to test the LLM process of writing and testing patterns.

Elena and Fede briefly discuss Zotero and how to coordinate the bibliography.

Giacomo suggests that the people who have the time to do that open the Excel spreadsheet and put their name down to read some of them. 

We give out tasks to people (Elena to polish up the outline, Cristian to work on CCO patterns, Giacomo to read 2 papers, the PHASES group to keep working on patterns, etc.)
